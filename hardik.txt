Hardik Pandya swears by living life king size and that exuberance finds expression in his powerful hitting in the middle order and brisk seam bowling. He first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2015, but displayed greater consistency in the Syed Mushtaq Ali domestic T20 tournament in January 2016. He finished as the leading run-getter, for Baroda, with 377 runs in 10 innings at an average of 53.85.
